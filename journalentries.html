     <p style = "font-size:21px; font-family: 'Open Sans Condensed', sans-serif"> Manuela M. Velosa, professor in the School of Computer Science at Carnagie Mellon, is the co-founder and Past President of the RoboCup Federation.
       She has helped create humanoid robots that play soccer according to the official rules of FIFA. The robots learn from the game and can actually communicate with each other to try to win. Ayanna Howard is a Georgia Tech Professer 
       who formerly worked at NASA. At her time in NASA, she experimented with and updated rovers that explore the surface of MARS. </p>
    
    <h2 style = "font-family: 'Fjalla One', sans-serif;"> Dancing Robots </h2>
     <p style = "font-size:21px; font-family: 'Open Sans Condensed', sans-serif"> Today, my group and I programmed robots to dance along to a song! Our robot danced to Shut Up and 
       Dance With Me by Walk the Moon. Through this process, I learned more about servos in relation with BoE shields and breadboards. For example, I learned how to connect the ground, control, 
       and power wires from the servos to the port 12 and 13 onto the Board of Education Shield. Although our robot did not perform some of the correct actions, I loved when our robot danced
       in circles.
       
       The robots created and programmed by Veloso and Howard were similar to my robot in that they all had a function and an output. Instead of having robots that dance, Veloso creates robots that play soccer. On the other hand, Howard
       creates and programs rovers that can autonomously explore the surface of Mars!
