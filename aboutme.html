    <p style = "font-size:21px; font-family: 'Open Sans Condensed', sans-serif"> Hi! My name is Simran. I am a senior at Walton High School. At school, I am in many clubs 
      including Math Team and the Walton Robotics Team. My favorite color is purple. I love painting,
      even though I'm not very artistic. I enjoy watching movies on Netflix. My favorite shows are White Collar, Friends, and How I Met Your Mother. I also like reading fiction books,
      like Harry Potter and Percy Jackson. I dislike running, playing sports, and watching ESPN. I love to travel. Over the course of my 17 years of life, I have been to more than 10 countries. 
      Recently, I went to Guatemala during the beginning of summer break. In Guatemala, I hiked up mountains and through rain forests to explore the Mayan culture. I also had the chance to visit a volcano!
      I have also been to Thailand and Singapore where I tried exotic foods and met new friends. A few years ago, my family and I took a cruise to the Bahamas and visited the US Virgin Islands, Peurto Rico, 
      and Dominica. Next, I want to travel to Australia! Look through this page to learn more about me! </p>
